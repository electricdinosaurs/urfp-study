## URFP Project

This project was conducted by Karen Yi during the course of the Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program (URFP), with the help of Mary Tucker and the Teaching and Learning Lab at UCLA. This has been a learning process, and I'm sure there is much here that will eventually stand corrected.

All materials used in the study are collected here, except for the actual data (in the interest of protecting participants).
