# Lesson 1: Operators

Most programming languages can act like basic calculators.

Try calculating `627 / 3` in the script.R window on the left. You will see the results of your code in the console on the right. (The character `#` means that everything on that line is a comment, and will be ignored by the computer.)

Tip: for the best experience, don't delete anything that we've already put in the script windows.

Nice! R supports all the basic functions: `*` for multiplication, `/` for division, `-` for subtraction, and `+` for addition.

You can also combine multiple operations, using `()` to tell R which operations you want to do first.

Try running `100 * 2 + 5`  and then `100 * (2 + 5)` in the window below.

You get an error. That's because coders use the `=` operator to create variables, which we will talk about later. If we want to check whether two values are equal to each other, use `==`.

Try checking whether `8` is equal to `8`, and then check whether `8 + 8` is equal to `16`.
