I'm a third-year student who took this course last year. I had no programming experience before I came to UCLA, and I struggled in this course early on. But my peer facilitator helped me understand the concepts better, and now I use R to analyze data from my undergraduate research project on Latinx parents' parenting methods around gender roles.

I joined the peer facilitator program because I wanted to give back to the UCLA community. You'll see me throughout the course giving feedback on your work. I hope you'll enjoy this course!
