# Extra Practice 2

When coders **visualize** data, they try to find patterns in the data that tell them something about the source of the data. We ask questions like: If we know your step count for a particular day, can we predict that day's average heart rate, and why? Or: How unusual is your highest recorded distance walked, compared to all the other days' distances?

In order to start answering these questions, we will start exploring graphs. Try running the code below.

Now that you see what the `gf_histogram` function does, modify the code so that it graphs `distance` instead of `heart_rate`. What do you notice about the tallest peaks of both of the graphs you've produced?

Great! You have probably inferred some information about how the `gf_histogram` function works. The `gf_dotplot` function is similar. Use this function to create a dot plot of `distance`. How does this compare to the histogram of `distance`? See if you can find similarities and differences.
