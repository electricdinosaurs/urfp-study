### Implicit Beliefs
Developed by psychologist Carol Dweck (1999), the “Kind of Person” Implicit Theory Scale is an 8-item measure that assesses how much people believe they can change and grow.

* The kind of person someone is, is something very basic about them and it can’t be changed very much.
* People can do things differently, but the important parts of who they are can’t really be changed.
* Everyone, no matter who they are, can significantly change their basic characteristics.
* As much as I hate to admit it, you can’t teach an old dog new tricks.  People can’t really change their deepest attributes.
* People can always substantially change the kind of person they are.
* Everyone is a certain kind of person, and there is not much that can be done to really change that.
* No matter what kind of person someone is, they can always change very much.
* All people can change even their most basic qualities.
