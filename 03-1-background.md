# Introduction

![](img/white-male-1.jpg)

Hi, it's great to meet you! My name is <span id="name">Dan Schuster</span>, and I am a psychology professor at a large research university. When I was an undergraduate, I struggled with learning data analysis. I had never had any experience in computer science before college, so it sometimes seemed like I was far behind everyone else. However, I was lucky to have a professor who supported me and convinced me that computer science would be useful in my future&mdash;not only in research, but also if I chose to become a psychology professional. 

Now, I use R to analyze my data almost every day. Over the past two years, I have also developed the following learning module. With this module, I hope to provide a less intimidating learning environment for students who, like me, entered college with no prior experience in computer science. I hope you enjoy the lesson.
