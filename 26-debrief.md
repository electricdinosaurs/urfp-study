Thank you for participating in this study.

This study asked the question: Do demographically similar role models help improve student persistence in computer science classes? The authors of this study noted that the field of computer science is lacking in ethnic and gender diversity. Unlike in some other science disciplines, computer science textbooks usually lack any mention of humans, which presents a unique problem. For example, biology textbooks have been shown to underrepresent Black women in particular, while overrepresenting white and Asian men, causing inaccurate stereotypes to be formed. However, in computer science it can be even more difficult to gauge whether one “belongs” in the class. 

We built on previous research showing that people tend to hold stereotypes about who can be computer scientists, and that people tend to categorize themselves and others as being “the type of person who can be successful at computer science” or not. We wanted to show that many people use computer science in their jobs all the time, even if their job titles don’t include the word “computer”. 

In this study, it was necessary not to fully disclose the nature of our hypotheses and research questions, as there is evidence that just knowing that researchers are studying race and gender can have a negative effect on students’ performance, as they experience the pressure to be a positive example of their particular demographic in a phenomenon known as “stereotype threat”. We hope that the study has caused you no lasting distress. If it has, consider contacting UCLA counseling services (CAPS) at (310) 825-0768 or feedback@caps.ucla.edu.

You may have been randomly placed in the condition where only white men were represented in the textbook materials. This is meant to simulate the levels of representation in many classrooms, textbooks, brochures, and videos in American classrooms, but by no means reflects the reality. Racial minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ folks are underrepresented in the CS community: take it as an opportunity to lend your voice. 

The Program in Computing department offers the PIC 10 series for an introduction to computer science principles, as well as the PIC 20 courses in Python for psychology. The Computer Science department offers CS 30 as an introduction to CS for nonmajors and people who have not had previous exposure to CS. 
The authors highly encourage you to consider taking these courses at any time during your studies at UCLA to gain a basic understanding of computer science principles. There is a high chance that they will be useful in your career, whatever it may be.
