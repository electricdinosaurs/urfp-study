Weâ€™re going to give you a chance to be a coder!

Coders (also called computer programmers) do all kinds of tasks, from running simulations to creating websites. Coders work in lots of different jobs and fields. In the field of data science, for example, coders organize, visualize, and analyze data.

Just like human languages, there are many computer programming languages, and each one is used by different groups of people. Unlike human languages, however, programming languages are usually built to accomplish specific purposes. For example, JavaScript is often used for writing computer games, and Swift is used to make apps. 

Today we will introduce you to a programming language built for analyzing data, called R. Data analysis involves organizing lots of information, or data, to reveal patterns. We can use these patterns as clues to help us understand how the world works. 

On the next few pages, you'll complete some tasks designed to help you be a coder who uses the R programming language.

Please try your best on each task.
